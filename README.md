##  Datasets Used

The project uses four core datasets:

| Dataset Name       | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `store_data`       | Information about store IDs, locations, types    |
| `sales_data`       | Daily sales records including product ID, store ID, date, and revenue |
| `customer_data`    | Demographic and behavioral data of customers     |
| `exchange_data`    | Currency exchange rates for multi-region analysis |

##  Technologies & Tools

- **Python** – For data cleaning and preprocessing (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`)
- **SQL** – For relational database storage and querying (MySQL)
- **Power BI** – For dashboard creation and interactive data visualization
- **Visual Studio Code** – For documenting analysis steps
- **Git** – Version control

##  Data Cleaning Steps

Performed using Python in `EDA_Analysis.ipynb` and VSCode:

- Removed duplicates and null values
- Standardized date formats and column names
- Merged datasets on foreign keys
- Converted currencies using exchange rate data
- Exported cleaned data for Power BI use
